Customer Segmentation
Background Overview
We help organizations understand and visualize data. We have found that even businesses that collect data points carefully and deliberately are often still sitting on a potential treasure chest of uncovered and, consequently, un-leveraged business intelligence. Imagine a situation in which you lead an online shop. Wouldn’t it be useful to identify separate groups of clients that show different shopping behaviors? For this blogpost I have put myself in the role of an online shop owner. Spoiler alert: based on the available data and Machine Learning methods I extracted three specific customer profiles. You can sneak a peek at the profiles in the radar charts below.
I detected that my customers fall into three groups. Each group can be characterized by product choice, frequency and number of purchases, as well as type of purchases.
I was even able to propose some promotional strategies to encourage each group to visit my shop in the future. If you want to learn the magic that stands behind the conversion of data to pricing and promotion strategy, as well as what hides behind the above radar charts, I encourage you to read the next sections.
The magic that allowed me to detect customer profiles is called customer segmentation. Customer Segmentation is a series of activities that aim to separate homogeneous groups of clients (retail or business) into subgroups based on their behavior during the purchase.

Literature Review
A customer relationship management system is a set of processes that help a business develop and maintain long-term relationships with its customers. Target customer analysis is a process that identifies the characteristics of a customer, while customer segmentation is a process that groups customers into homogeneous groups. This process is done by carrying out a cluster analysis to get a set of predefined segments. The customer identification process is followed by the attraction and retention of the identified customers.
The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:
The process of creating, delivering, delivering, and exchanging products of value to customers, customers, partners and society at large (approved July 203) Philip Kotler defines marketing as a social process by which individuals and groups gain. They need and want each other by creating, providing, and freely exchanging products and services that are valuable to each other. The concept of marketing suggests that the reason for success lies in a company's ability to create, deliver and deliver a better value proposition through marketing compared to its competitors for a chosen target segment. Market segmentation is the process of dividing customers into homogeneous groups with similar characteristics such as shopping habits, lifestyle, food preferences, etc.
Brewer and Speh (2000) developed a supply chain performance measurement model using balanced scorecards. Bethel and Jayaram (1997) argue that it is necessary to use a cross-functional, integrated measure, because it avoids optimization at one point in the chain without considering potential consequences at other points in the chain. Many companies have not done this. You have succeeded in maximizing your offer. Developing the performance metrics and metrics needed to unlock network potential. Fully integrate your supply chain for maximum efficiency and effectiveness. Gunasekaran et al. (2004) developed a framework for better understanding the importance of measures and SCM performance indicators Maltz et al. (2003) developed a performance evaluation system called dynamic multivariate performance (DMP).

Problem Statement
Customer Segmentation is the process of division of the customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and
miscellaneous spending habits.
Our problem includes the 3 major steps
1) Identifying the Potential Customer base for selling the product
2) Implementing clustering algorithm to group customer base
3) Selling product to identified customer group. Our work is to
separate our customers into distinct groups based on their purchase
behavior.
And finally finding a customer base who are interested in a given product by selecting the clusters of customers.
In this project ,our task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational dataset which contains all transactions occuring between 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-ocassion gifts.Many customers of company are wholesalers.

The Objective of the Research
The General objective of customer segmentation:
 The process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so company can market to each group effectively and appropriately.
In essence, the specific objectives of segmentation are:
 To improve an organization’s understanding of who their prospective customers are and how to serve them
 To reduce risk in deciding where, when, how, and to whom a product, service, or brand will be marketed
 To increase marketing efficiency by directing effort toward designated segment(s) in ways that are consistent with that segment’s characteristics

Scope of Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation can help you divide a diverse market into a number of smaller, more homogeneous markets based on one or more meaningful characteristics. Segmentation helps you better understand your customers and their various needs and wants.
Segmentation can help:
1. Improve your understanding of current and potential customers. 2. Address business challenges and opportunities.
3. Identify and estimate market opportunities.
4. Tailor products, services, and customer experiences.
5. Shape communications.
The scope of segmentation strategy depends on the maturity of your organization, the diversity of your market, your timeline, and budget.


Limitations of Customer Segmentation
1. The effectiveness of marketing messages may be hampered by a "one-size-fits- all" approach to the consumers within a given demographic segment.
2. Skewed or problematic demographic data within a given region can produce unreliable assumptions, potentially reducing the accuracy of your marketing message and methods.
3. While consumer behavior can be tracked, it is not always easy to pinpoint the motivations behind those behaviors, as they can vary greatly from person to person.
4. Behavioral segmentation is often based on complex data constructs that are not always easy to understand.
5. Translating attitudinal characteristics into a conventional database model can be challenging, and can sometimes lead to loss of effectiveness in terms of replicability.


Significance
Customer segmentation is one of the most important marketing tools at your disposal, because it can help a business to better understand its target audience. This is because it groups customers based on common characteristics. Sometimes a one- size-fits-all policy doesn’t apply, and that’s often the case when it comes to marketing. Customer segmentation is about actively trying to group customers together based on their buying habits and behaviors. This allows you to better target your audience with relevant messaging.
These groups can be used to build an overview of customers, it's data is like gold dust for many organizations.
Once you know your audience, the buyer persona, and how they spend their money, you’re in a strong position to gain their custom and retain it.
Another reason why customer segmentation is important is that you may begin to unearth new ideas based on what your customers are saying. Consumers are constantly changing their buying habits, and brands are tasked with predicting these changes before they happen. When you utilize customer segmentation, you’ll never miss out on what’s trending. You can add to the product development process based on your customer’s preferences.


Conclusion
Customer segmentation is only effective if it is a cross-functional endeavor from the very start. While my team was responsible for taking segmentation from a business need to a functional tool, its success rested on Marketing, Sales, Product, Finance, and Analytics buy-in. After all, different customer needs – a clarified view of which is the result of segmentation – implies different features to build, different distribution and positioning in the market, and different sales motions.
Getting segmentation right without substantial analysis, stakeholder feedback, and iteration is unlikely. Ultimately, alignment and adoption need to go hand in hand so that all teams can benefit from understanding the business using this new framework.
In this data science project, we went through the customer segmentation model. We developed this using a class of machine learning known as unsupervised learning. Specifically, we made use of a clustering algorithm called K-means clustering. We analyzed and visualized the data and then proceeded to implement our algorithm.
